# To-Do
A To-Do list creator implemented in Angular.

This project is a basic implementation of using the Angular MVC architecture.

It displays an initial set of to-do lists with items by making an ajax call for a json file. New items could be added to the list,
deleted from the list and the list name could be edited.
The application also supports Undo-Redo operations triggered from the keyboard using the shortcuts Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y.

The entire workarea is divided into two separate workspaces where the nav-bar emits the action of creating the To-Do list block into the
to-do list area.

Feel free to explore!
